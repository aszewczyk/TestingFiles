batwo_tThe Doctor was the main alias used by a renegade Time Lord from Gallifrey who travelled through time and space with various companions in his obsolete and "borrowed" Type 40 TARDIS. batwo_tHe was the universe's "greatest defender", having saved the cosmos thousands of times throughout his long life, becoming a great legend across the whole universe.

baThough largely a believer in non-violent conflict resolution, he was, when absolutely necessary, a great warrior. baIndeed, some civilisations in the universe (e.g. the denizens of the Gamma Forests) translated the word doctor as warrior, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War) whilst others saw him as a compassionate benefactor, worthy of their admiration and compassion. ba(TV: Last of the Time Lords, The Wedding of River Song)
