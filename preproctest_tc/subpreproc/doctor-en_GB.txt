rea"The Doctor" was the main alias used by a renegade Time Lord from Gallifrey who travelled through time and space with various companions in his obsolete and "borrowed" Type 40 TARDIS. reaHe was the universe's "greatest defender", having saved the cosmos thousands of times throughout his long life, becoming a great legend across the whole universe.

reaThough largely a believer in non-violent conflict resolution, he was, when absolutely necessary, a great warrior. reaIndeed, some civilisations in the universe (e.g. the denizens of the Gamma Forests) translated the word doctor as warrior, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War) whilst others saw him as a compassionate benefactor, worthy of their admiration and compassion. rea(TV: Last of the Time Lords, The Wedding of River Song)
