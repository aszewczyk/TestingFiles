O hush thee, my dove,

O hush thee, my rowan,

O hush thee, my lapwing,

My little brown bird.

O fold thy wing and seek thy nest now,

O shine the berry on the bright tree,

The bird is home from the mountain and valley,

Oh hush thee, my birdie, my pretty dearie

Oh hush thee, my birdie, my pretty dearie.
